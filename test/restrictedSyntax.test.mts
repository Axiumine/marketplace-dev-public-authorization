 * The `no-restricted-syntax` block in `eslint.config.js`, proved one selector at a time.
 *
 * A rule nobody exercises is a comment. Each fixture below is the *exact* shape the rule exists to
 * refuse — including the assignment form the audit actually found, which a `Property`-only selector
 * would have let through — and the last one is the compliant shape, which must stay silent.
 *
 * The fixtures are `.mts.fixture` rather than `.mts` on purpose: a real `.mts` under `test/` would be
 * linted by `yarn lint` and report the very findings it is here to contain, and adding it to `ignores`
 * would then hide it from this suite too. They are read as text and linted through `lintText` at a
 * `test/`-shaped path, which is the config this block applies to along with every other file.

 * correctly scoped rule from one that stopped firing altogether.
 *
 * ⚠️ `SRC_PATH` is an existing source file, not the invented name `TEST_PATH` is. The shared config's
 * TypeScript block carries `parserOptions.project`, and a path under `src/` that no file occupies is
 * not in the TS program — the parser then fails the whole lint with a fatal error and reports no rule
 * messages at all, which reads exactly like a rule that stopped firing. The content linted is the
